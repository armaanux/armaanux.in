### Let me set the scene

You've been waiting all week to watch that one movie. You've got snacks, headphones and the perfect mood. You hit play, the movie starts and then... no subtitles.

So you pause. You open five sketchy websites. You type the movie name followed by "English subtitles .srt". You download one file. Doesn't match. You try another. Still off. Now you're syncing it manually. You give up and watch the movie guessing half the dialogue or just reading subtitles that ruin every scene two seconds too early.

It's ridiculous. And honestly, I'm over it.

### Subtitles shouldn't be this hard. But they still are

We've got AI that can write poems, generate code and create hyper-realistic art in seconds. But subtitles? Still stuck in 2009.

If you're watching on Netflix or YouTube, maybe you're fine. But the second you go outside those, it falls apart. Downloaded movies. Foreign films. Indie content. Anything not served by a major platform.

Here's what I keep running into:

- Subtitles are missing entirely
- They're in the wrong language
- They're out of sync by a few seconds
- They spoil the dialogue before it's spoken
- They don't match your video version
- They only work in specific players
- They look awful or cluttered
- They're just plain wrong

Even when I'm watching in English, I still want subtitles. Maybe the actor's whispering. Maybe the background score is too loud. Maybe I'm tired and can't focus. But subtitles? Still unreliable.

And when I do manage to find them, it feels like solving a puzzle just to make them work. It's 2025 and this should not be a thing.

### So I thought, why isn't there a smarter way?

What I wanted was simple.

An app or extension that just listens to whatever's playing on my screen, understands the audio in real time and gives me clean, synced captions. Right there on top of the video. No downloading. No syncing. No spoilers.

It doesn't matter what I'm watching or where it's from. If it's playing on my system, I want captions to show up automatically.

Sounds basic, right? But for some reason, this doesn't exist in a good way.

### I don't code, but I design. So I'm building it from my side

I'm a UI/UX designer. I'm not writing code for this, but I'm working on what the experience should feel like. How the captions appear. Where they show up. How clean the interface looks. How it stays out of your way until you need it.

As of now, I'm still working on the interface and figuring out the full flow. Once it's ready, I'll be updating this blog with the Figma link so you can see what I'm building.

It's going to be minimal, smart and most importantly, built around the way real people watch content. Not some overly technical tool. Just something that works.

---

### Why this actually matters

Yes, I'm doing this for people like me who are tired of hunting for subtitles. But this can help way more than just movie nerds on the internet.

This could help:

- People who are deaf or hard of hearing
- People learning new languages through shows and films
- Viewers with audio processing difficulties
- People watching content in public or quiet spaces
- Anyone outside the mainstream content bubble

It's not just about convenience. It's about making sure people don't get excluded from content just because a subtitle file doesn't exist or isn't synced correctly.

Everyone deserves to understand what they're watching. Without all the extra work.

### The tech exists. No one's put it together right yet

Real-time transcription is already here. OpenAI's Whisper, local AI models, audio capture tools, all of it is doable.

But the tools out there are either too technical, too clunky or just plain ugly. Nothing feels like a thoughtful, designed-for-humans solution that anyone can open and just use.

That's where I come in.

I want to make something that's simple and user-first. You open your video. It listens. It gives you clean captions in real time. No questions asked.

---

### Where this is going

I don't have a finished UI yet. I don't have a dev building it right now. But I've started shaping the idea. And I know there are people out there who would use this the second it exists.

If you're a developer who loves solving problems with AI, this might be the project you've been looking for.

If you're just someone who's tired of subtitles spoiling the best scenes, trust me, I get it.

This is for us. Apes together strong.

I'll be sharing the UI link here soon. Stay tuned.
